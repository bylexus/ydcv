Your Daily Comic Viewer - my first Sencha Touch 2.x approach

A very simplistic comic viewer app for the phone (based on Sencha Touch,
so hopefully works anywhere). First commits, Version 0.1a working with only XKCD.

The following comics are implemented now:
- XKCD
- Dilbert
- SMBC (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal)

To run it in Chrome, start Chrome with "--disable-web-security", because
the app is requesting cross-site resources (xkcd.com, dilbert.com).

Have fun!
